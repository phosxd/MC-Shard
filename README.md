Shard is an upcoming all-in-one add-on for servers & realms! With a fully modular & customizable design, Shard will have a vast multitude of management, utility, fun, survival+, & moderation modules soon.

Version: 0.0.1.

# Installation:
Shard is only available for Minecraft Bedrock 1.21.100 or higher.
- Download the latest release on [Github](https://github.com/phosxd/mc-shard) or [Discord](https://dsc.gg/mc-shard).
- Double click or open the downloaded `.mcaddon` file.
- Apply the pack to your world.

You DO NOT need:
- Beta-APIs.
- Any experimental features enabled.

You DO need:
- Cheats enabled.

If you followed the instructions perfectly, when enetering your world you should receive a pretty "This server is running Shard" message.

# Getting started:
To get started, type `/sh:` in chat (but do not send) to view auto-completes for every command for every Shard module.

You can configure modules by using the `/module <module>` command. With this you can toggle, print data & reset data. Disabling a module will also disable all it's commands. There is not yet a feature to disable individual commands.

There are a bunch of useful commands from the `util` module to play around with to start off. Just remember this version of Shard is an early alpha & there are only a few features currently available.

# Modules:
## `core`:
Provides essential functionality for the add-on. Cannot be disabled.
**Commands:**
